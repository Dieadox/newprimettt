A mine, with a red laster, placeable on walls. When the red laser is crossed by innocents or detectives, the mine explodes.

This is a modified, now working, version of a non working swep to which I can't find the original author.
Thanks to AmbientFreak and  Bad King Urgrain (with his sexy eagle eyes), from the TTT forums, for making this possible."
